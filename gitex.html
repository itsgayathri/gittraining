   <h1 color:brown>The Lion And The Mouse</h1>
   <p style=border:2px solid Violet> One day in the jungle, the lion lay asleep. A little mouse playing about runs up and down on the sleeping lion.<br>“Aaargh!” roared the lion and held up the squeaking little mouse.<br>“Please let me go! Let me go! I will help you one day for your kindness today!” squealed the little mouse.<br>“Youre too tiny to help me! Off you go,” said the lion amused as the little mouse ran away.<br>    A few days go by when the little mouse heard a roar: “Help me!”<br>The little mouse was scared but it walked on and on until it came across the lion caught in the net!<br>   
    “I see you need my help now!” it said.<br>    
    “Please help me!” groaned the lion in pain.<br>    
    The little one immediately chewed across the net until the lion was free.<br>    
    From that day on the lion and the mouse remained friends!<br></p>
